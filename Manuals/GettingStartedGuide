Setup Hardware

Refer to picture above for location of various hardware features.

    Z280RC needs a 5V power supply with maximum current of 400mA.
    A TTL-level serial adapter with Transmit and Receive and ground signals. No handshake signals are required. The terminal program parameters are: 115200 baud, Odd parity, 8 data bit, 1 stop and no handshake.
    To boot from the CF disk, be sure the mode jumper is inserted.
    The included CF already has all the necessary software installed in track 0. CPM2.2 distribution files are on drive B, CPM3 distribution files are on drive A.
    Refer to manual for software installation on a new CF
    when power is applied, the expected current is 300mA-400mA
    The signal assignment of the serial port is designed for the 6-pin CP2102 USB adapter below. Other USB adapter may also be used. Only three signals need to be connected: RxD, TxD and Ground.

ZZMon

When the board is powered up with the mode jumper installed and a properly programed CF inserted, the ZZMon power up sign on message will be displayed on the console:

CP/M3 distribution files are stored in drive A and another copy in drive C.
RAM Drive

Drive E is the RAM drive. The 1.5meg CP/M RAM drive is physically located in memory 0x80000-0x1FFFFF. RAM drive's directory needs to be initialized to 0xE5. This is done with ZZMon using the command:

xE (press enter to execute) ←please note the drive letter E must be in upper case.
